          <p>"Currently reading the series and really enjoying it. I'm a long way past being a teenager, but an avid fantasy series reader. The story in my opinion is able to draw me in, and as mentioned by others, a bit teenage romantic in very small doses, which does not affect the story, and provides some grounding as to who the main character is. Without any emotion the character would have no depth. A very easy series to read, and I will finish the whole series."</p>

            When magic has gone from the world, and a vicious king rules from his throne of glass, an assassin comes to the castle. She does not come to kill, but to win her freedom. If she can defeat twenty-three killers, thieves, and warriors in a competition to find the greatest assassin in the land, she will become the king’s champion and earn her freedom. Her name is Celaena Sardothien – beautiful, deadly, and destined for greatness.
